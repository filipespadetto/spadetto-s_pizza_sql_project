# Spadetto's Pizza

# Project Description
The Spadetto's Pizza project is a management and ordering system for a fictional pizzeria that sells to customers on a daily basis. This system helps automate various essential tasks, such as order recording, menu management, delivery tracking, and employee records.

- Menu Management: The pizzeria can update the menu with new pizzas, prices, ingredients, and descriptions.
